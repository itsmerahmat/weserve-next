This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Thank You

I created this website as an experimental project to learn and try the features available in Next.js. I converted the [HTML](https://shaynakit.com/details/weserve-html5-responsive-design-template-landing-page) and [Figma designs](https://shaynakit.com/details/weserve-hosting-provider-website-design) from the "[ShaynaKit](https://shaynakit.com/landing)" template into the Next.js framework.
